# genesass/genuflex
A sassified version of Genesis Sample Theme, with some extra code snippets for optimisation, etc. The CSS also uses flexbox rather than floats.

The main branch is just the Genesis Sample Theme css re-worked into SCSS format, with variables.

I've added a bunch of color definitions (mostly based on the Material Design A400 colours), and some cool mixins (I especially love the choose-contrast-colour() function!)

See CHANGELOG.md for changes.
